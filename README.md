## 🎨 Design and Branding

  - Purple `#7B61FF`  
- **Typography:** Clean, sans-serif fonts for readability  
- **Single Page:** responsive, attractive and unique 
      **Reason:** I created a single page scrolling website using HTML and CSS to showcase smooth navigation and modern web design techniques.

Single page websites provide faster loading, seamless navigation, and better storytelling, allowing users to access all information without page reloads.
